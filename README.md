Live site testing : https://samuelparkertech.github.io/WWBC-3CODETEERS-HACK1/index.html
This includes validator testing. 

# Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

# Other General Project Advice
We struggled a bit with Github forks and forking, although we were able to resolve this. As our first time it was a bit daunting. 
I (Samuel) struggled with Github Projects page as I had not used this before, I used Trello as an alternative as I have experience of viewing these boards before.
